  ## Description
  #JavaScript30 - Project #7 - Array Cardio, Day 2
  <br><br>

  These code exercises use the following technologies: JavaScript. 
  <br><br>
  Another day for practicing array methods. Interested to use some and every. Also had some practice with findAll and splice. And had the occasion to use the spread method that came up yesterday. 
  <br><br>
  Definitely seeing the value and reviewing and practicing these methods until they come very easily to one.
